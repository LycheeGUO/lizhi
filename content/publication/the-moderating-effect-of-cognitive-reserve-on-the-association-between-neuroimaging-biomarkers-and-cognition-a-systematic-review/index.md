abstract: This systematic review aims to investigate the moderating effects of
  cognitive reserve (CR) on the relationships between cognitive function and
  multimodal Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-signatured brain changes, measured by
  positron emission tomography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging
  (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). Through a comprehensive search of PubMed,
  Scopus, and Web of Science, we identified 55 eligible studies examining the
  moderating effect of CR on the relationship between neuroimaging biomarkers
  and cognitive outcomes. CR measurements include sociobehavioral proxies (e.g.,
  education, leisure activities), residual approaches, and functional imaging
  approaches. Findings were mixed. Of the fifty-five studies, 41 studies
  reported a protective effect of CR, suggesting its buffering effect against
  cognitive decline or AD progression during ageing. However, eleven studies
  reported no interaction between CR and neuroimaging biomarkers. Six studies
  suggested a detrimental effect of CR in the middle-to-late stages of the
  disease [e.g., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD] (three studies reported
  both protective and detrimental effects). The discrepancies may reflect that
  the influence of CR on the association between neuroimaging biomarkers and
  cognitive function depends on disease stage. In early stages, it exhibits
  protective effects, but as pathology accumulates, it may accelerate cognitive
  decline. This review revealed CR has heterogeneous effects on AD progression.
  We preliminarily identified a “critical point” for CR within the continuum
  between cognitively unimpaired (CU) and MCI, although its precise pathological
  determinants require further clarification. Establishing standardized CR
  metrics and conducting longitudinal biomarker-integrated studies are critical
  to pinpoint optimal intervention windows for maximizing CR’s protective
  effects.

summary: |-
  CR buffers early AD cognitive impact from neuroimaging biomarkers.
  High CR may lead to sharper cognitive decline in later AD stages.
  CR’s “critical point” may lie between CU and MCI stages.
